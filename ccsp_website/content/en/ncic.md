(Phnom Penh) : On April 6, 2025, our Committee for Community Services Program team, together with students from the Environmental Sciences class and colleagues from Bridge Bank, delivered donations to the National Center for Infants and Children.

The donations included:

- 100 bottles of Manoprovitab
- 5 plastic mats
- 100 brooms
- 12 water storage containers (80L and 100L)
- 6 packs of diapers
- 15 bottles of baby oil
- 18 loaves of bread
- 10 boxes of Yeo’s drinks
- 2 sacks of rice
- A variety of cookies, milk, and clothing
- 840,000 riels in cash, donated to the center’s staff

We would like to take this moment to express our sincere thanks to the Bridge Bank team for joining us, to Yeo’s Cambodia for donating 10 boxes of Yeo’s drinks, and to everyone else who contributed to this meaningful event. It’s not about the size of the donation, but the generosity and care you show for our community. We hope to continue being a force for good in our world.
