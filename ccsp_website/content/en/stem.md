(Takeo) : CCSP proudly led the STEM4Change Project, a community service initiative that inspired 90 students at the community school “I See I Do” in Takeo province! Through hands-on STEM workshops on water sanitation, waste management, basic technology, and budgeting, CCSP helped foster practical skills and problem-solving confidence among the students.

Thanks to everyone’s support, CCSP also raised $400 through fundraising, which was donated to enhance the school’s facilities for the students. CCSP hopes to inspire kids in the community to believe in themselves, dream big, and work toward a brighter future.

At AUPP, we believe the potential of education drives positive change. Join us in our journey toward a more socially responsible and sustainable future. Together, we can make a lasting impact.
