(Phnom Penh) : After six weeks of training and collaboration, our volunteers from team 1 Cohort 1 successfully completed the CyberAI Explorer service at Neeson Cripps Academy on 27th August and 3rd September, dedicating two Wednesdays to this initiative.
We aimed to spread awareness about cybersecurity and share essential cyber hygiene practices to help kids stay safe online. Beyond that, we also introduced them to the world of Artificial Intelligence by teaching how to become better prompt engineers and use AI responsibly and ethically.
We would like to express our deepest gratitude to the American University of Phnom Penh for continuously supporting our initiative, to the cybersecurity specialists from ក្រសួងប្រៃសណីយ៍ និងទូរគមនាគមន៍ - Ministry of Post and Telecommunications for their guidance, and to our incredible volunteers who dedicated their valuable time to make this program possible.
Through this initiative, we hope to inspire the next generation to embrace technology especially in the fields of cybersecurity and artificial intelligence and to empower them to use it wisely for the future.
