                                The Committee for Community Service Program (CCSP) at the American University of Phnom Penh (AUPP) is a student-led initiative committed to fostering social responsibility and community engagement. Our mission is to bridge academic learning with real-world impact, empowering students to make meaningful contributions to Cambodian society through a range of community-driven projects.

                                Our initiatives address pressing social issues, providing students with valuable hands-on experiences. By applying their knowledge in practical ways, students are able to create positive change within their communities.
